    <h1>Social Engineering</h1>
    <h2>What is "Social Engineering"?</h2>
    <p>Though there are a few definitions for this, the most common one in regards to Cybersecurity is that Social Engineering is the use of deception to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential or personal information that may be used for fraudulent purposes.</p>
    <h2>Common Social Engineering Tactics</h2>
    <p><cite>According to Imperva</cite></p>
    <h3>Baiting</h3>
    <p>Baiting is most commonly used when an attacker leaves some form of physical media, like a flash drive, in an area where it is likely to be found and used by someone working for a targetted company. When the flash drive is plugged in to a device, malware is automatically installed.</p>
    <h3>Phishing</h3>
    <p>Phishing is the most popular form of social ingineering tactics, as it targets victims through common forms of communication such as email and text messages. Attackers send out messages that are designed to look legitimate in the eyes of the victim, such as a request to change a password or a link to a "required" company survey. These messages are designed to look nearly identical to those that users may normally receive. However, these attacks, for example, result in victims giving attackers their passwords, or they may click on a link that results in the installation of malware.  </p>
    <h3>Scareware</h3>
    <p>Scareware is most commonly used when an attacker uses pop-ups within a browser to display text with illegitimate claims that your device has been infected with malware. Victims then click these links or popups, believing that their device may be at risk, and are redirected to a malicious cite that results in the device actually becoming infected.</p>
